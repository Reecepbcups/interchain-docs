# Overview

:::note Synopsis

This section will guide you though the documentation and get you to where you need to go. Whether you have no development experience and want to know where to start, or are experienced and looking to see what all we have to offer.

## Absolute Beginners

As an absolute beginner you are recommended to look into general programming and understanding development processes. Depending on your interest different paths will suite you.

### Backend

Backend is the logic behind the scenes. What is run but the user does not see. This is where the data is stored and processed. If you are interested in this path you should look into the following:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/) - A programming language that is used in many blockchain projects.
- [Linux Basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) - A basic understanding of the command line is essential for development.

Having a strong foundation in these 2 areas will propel you forward on your application development journey.

### Frontend

Frontend is the user interface. It interacts with the backend but also must display the data in a way that is easy to understand, requiring more design skills. If you are interested in this path you should look into the following:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [HTML/CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - The basic building blocks of the web.
