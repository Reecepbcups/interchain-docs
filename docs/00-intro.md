# The Interchain

The Interchain is a network of independent applications built using the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go), and other interoperability focused protocols. These network applications can connect together to form a global mesh network of blockchains, sharing financial resources, data, and power between them.

## Who Is This For?
